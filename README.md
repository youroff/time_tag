TimeTag (even far from alpha now)
==========

This supposes to be a little library that parses and represents smart and flexible time objects.

Aimed to support:
- Cyclic/single time prescription: "Each friday", "Next sunday"
- Point/Interval time: "at 12pm", "from 12 to 20 hours"
- Suggest: you type "sun" it suggests sunday

+ AR adapter to use it with Rails
